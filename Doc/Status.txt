The current release version of Corps Python, 0.1, should be considered a Developer's Evaluation version.

Concs are fully supported.

ExtCorps can be created from scripts or by other Corps, and ContCorps can be created by existing Corps.

Interoperability between Concs, ExtCorps, and ContCorps is fully operational.

Prominent features such as multi-host Corps, Python functions as Workers (Funcs), Auto-Scaling, Auto-Healing, etc. are
not yet available.

Some aspects of the current implementation are not in their final form.  All messaging between Workers uses the
Tcp/IP V4 network stack.  The FastPath implementation for messaging within the same Env which uses inter-thread
Queues (and requires no pickling/unpickling) must be coded.

A FastPath solution for messaging between Workers within the same host, but different Envs (and thus different
processes), must be investigated. It is not clear if a LocalHost network implementation will be inferior to IPC
mechanisms such as Queue or Shared Memory given that pickling/unpickling is still required and can present
significant overhead that may dominate the other costs.

The standard pickling library which is used for all cross-process (and thus all cross-Env) traffic is woefully
inadequate. Too many types, especially ones defined at run-time, are not supported by pickle.  Further investigation
is planned to look at solutions such as dill or cloudpickle for their applicability and performance.

In addition, testing across Python versions and implementations and operating systems has been minimal.

However, excepting those caveats, properly decomposed multi-Env microservices, services, and applications can still be
developed for a single, multi-core, multi-processor host that are reasonably performant.

For now a simple workaround for the lack of Funcs is adding a method per Python function to a Conc subclass (a
Conc is a type of Worker for Python class-based objects).  The new method should mimic the api for the function.
